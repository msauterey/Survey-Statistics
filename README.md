# Survey-Statistics

This course is concerned with sampling methodology in finite populations. We will cover simple random sampling, stratification, cluster sampling, and unequal probability sampling; and develop ratio and regression estimation methods for simple random and stratified samples. Model-based and Bayesian approaches to survey sampling will be introduced, and contrasted with the classical design-based approach. By the end of the course students will be able to distinguish between different sampling schemes, identify suitable sampling methods based on known characteristics of the population, and conduct statistical analysis of survey data.
